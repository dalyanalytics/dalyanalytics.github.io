Daly Analytics can elevate your data science capabilities, enable your team to generate better insights and increase your efficiency by acting as a fractional Head of Data Science. We leverage the most popular programming language and web framework for data science, **R Programming** and **Shiny**. We have three core services and the potential availability to conduct in-house or virtual corporate training to teach technical and non-technical folks. 
 
 
#### ⚡️ Shiny web app development 

> Shiny is a web application framework for R, requiring no advanced knowledge of web development tools.

We have experience developing and mantaining shiny apps for various industries including but not limited to: 
- [Bioinformatics](https://github.com/jasdumas/shinyGEO)
- [Public Safety](https://jasminedumas.shinyapps.io/hartford-crime/)
- [Real Estate](https://jasdumas.github.io/tech-short-papers/flex-realestate.html)
- Edge Cloud Traffic
- Finance

Let us assist you by improving app layouts for greater usability, implementing more graceful error handling, and supercharging your graphs into dynamic interactive visualizations with reactive widgets.

#### 🔮 Predictive analytics

We can provide end-to-end data science services with a emphasis on predictive modeling and machine learning. Let us assist you in turning unstructured text data into actionable insights by gleaning implicit sentiment from surveys. Looking to improve your model's performance, let us advise on **feature engineering, pre-processing, sampling techniques and evaluation metrics**.


#### 📦 Data Science architecture

We can support the development of transitioning monolith R scripts into functions into R packages. Let us develop and review your submission to The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), the central repository for R software to ensure timely public release of your open source tooling.
