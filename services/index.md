Daly Analytics can elevate your data science capabilities and efficency by enabling your team to generate actionable business and product insights. We leverage the most popular statistical programming language and web framework for data science, **R Programming** and **Shiny**. 

We offer three core services and have availability to conduct in-house or virtual corporate training for introductory data analytics with R programming. 
 
#### ‚ö°Ô∏è Shiny web app development 

Daly Analytics can improve shiny application UI/UX for greater usability for technical & non-technical users, implement more graceful app error handling, and bring clarity to your data visualizations with interactive reactive widgets. We have extensive experience developing and mantaining shiny apps for various industries and use-cases. Here are a few examples projects: 

- [Survival and Differential Expression Analysis of Gene Expression Data](https://gdancik.shinyapps.io/shinyGEO/)
- [Leveraging the Keras API for Deep Learning Image Classification](https://dalyanalytics.shinyapps.io/image_clf/)
- [Interactive US County Population Map with Leaflet](https://dalyanalytics.shinyapps.io/Choropleth_Zipcodes/)


#### üîÆ Predictive Analytics & ML

We can provide end-to-end data science and analytics services which includes: 

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning/Pre-processing
- Feature Engineering
- Building Forecasting & Machine Learning Models
- Improving Model Performance and Metric Selection
- Transforming Analyses into Reproducible Scripts & Shiny Applications. 


#### üì¶ Data Science Architecture

We can support and drive the development of transitioning large R scripts into functions and R packages for internal use. Let us develop and review your submission to The Comprehensive R Archive Network ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)), the central repository for R software to ensure timely public release of your open source tooling. We have authored & maintain several popular R packages currently available on CRAN:

- [`shinyLP` provides functions that wrap HTML Bootstrap code to enable the design and layout of informative landing home pages for Shiny applications](https://github.com/jasdumas/shinyLP)  [![](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/shinyLP)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shinyLP)
  
- [`ttbbeer` provides datasets for materials used at U.S. breweries and historical tax rates](https://github.com/jasdumas/ttbbeer)  [![](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/ttbbeer)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ttbbeer)
